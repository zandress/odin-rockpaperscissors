Rock Paper Scissors Project

This project I will be creating a program that will play a computer in a game of rock paper scissors.
The computer will be randminzed with which of the 3 options it chooses.
The user will manually enter their selection inside the script.
I will be using functions, if/else conditionals, and loops to create and play the game.
First to 5 wins will be the winner.

I will revisit this project in the future to add a GUI that has buttons and text!
